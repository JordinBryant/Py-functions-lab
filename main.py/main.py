# CHALLENGE 1
# Write a function named sum_to that accepts a single integer, n, and returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n. For example:

# total = 0
# def sum_to(n):
#  print(sum(range(1, n+1)))

# sum_to(5)

  # CHALLENGE 2
# Write a function named largest that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the largest number in that list.

# largest([1, 2, 3, 4, 0])  returns 4
# largest([10, 4, 2, 231, 91, 54]) returns 231

# list_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0]
# largest_number = 0

# def largest(list):
#   max = list[0]
#   for num in list:
#     if num > max:
#       max = num
#   return max

# print(largest(list_1))


#CHALLENGE 3
# Write a function named occurances that takes two string arguments as input and counts the number of occurances of the second string inside the first string.

# txt = "I love apples, apple are my favorite fruit"
# x = txt.count("apple")

# print(x)




# CHALLENGE #4
# Write a function named product that takes an arbitrary number of numbers, multiplies them all together, and returns the product.
# (HINT: Review your notes on *args).

# def product(*args):
#     product = (-1, 4)
#     for item in args:
#         product *= item
#     return product
       

# print(product(4))
